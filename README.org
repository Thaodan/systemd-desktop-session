* General Startup
User Session is started via systemd autologin or via systemd xdg xsession in login manager
0. Systemd User starts
1. call of  users default.target
2. default target wants DEs target
3. DEs target wants: XDG-DE.target <DE specific stuff> xdg-autostart.target
4  XDG-target wants: de_init.service display-manager.service dbus.socket 


* XDG-DE.target
pulls some stuff for services that are non DE specific like pulseaudio if enabled

** display-manager.service
Provided by any display-manager, just to make shure that a display service is running (for example if we are in tty)
** de_init.service
   Init Basic DE stuff like:
   *set mouse theme
   * set randr stuff
   * set for fonts dpi
   * source env files (/etc/profile.d, source stuff that should only runned if DE is running)
  
* DE specific targets
Targets that pull specific targets or services.

Desktop Enviroment examples:
** KDE (kde.target)
   init_kde.service
   pulls kded.service
   pulls kded-modules.target
   



* XDG Autostart.target
Targets that are started after a DE is  running.
This services  are to install when autostart.target is wanted (unless set that is not)
